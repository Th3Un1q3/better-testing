# Lesson #2

## Task 1
- explore [Base test](../../tests/unit/lesson-02/explore-base-sequence.spec.js)
- DON'T RUN THE TEST
- Arrange cards according to their appearance in console
- Compare your answer with the actual result and try to explain differences

## Task 2
- explore [Mock test](../../tests/unit/lesson-02/explore-mock-sequence.spec.js)
- DON'T RUN THE TEST
- Arrange cards according to their appearance in console
- Compare your answer with the actual result and try to explain differences

## Task 3
- write a `sqrt` function that would return a square root for a value
### Guidance
- Use TDD approach
- Strictly follow [Red Green Refactor](../patterns/red-green-refactor.md) pattern.
- Use [Triangulation](../patterns/triangulation.md) pattern
### Questions
- what edge cases could be in that function?
- in which cases `triangulation` is applicable?

## Task 4
- write a `isNil` function that would return true if incoming value is null or undefined
### Guidance
- Use TDD approach
- Strictly follow [Red Green Refactor](../patterns/red-green-refactor.md) pattern.
- Use [Fake it till you make it](../patterns/fake-it.md) pattern
### Questions
- in which cases `fake it till you make it` is applicable

## Home Work
Write 5 test suites under guidance from [testing checklist](../patterns/test-suite-checklist.md)
