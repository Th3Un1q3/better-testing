## Sequence
Can you say what will be in the console if I run `01/src/explore-sequence.spec.js`
* Why it's important to understand test execution sequence?

## Boundaries

Write `inRange` function that accepts a number low and high border of the range.
Write `sqrt` function that accepts a number and returns a square root of it

Try to strictly follow red green refactor pattern.
