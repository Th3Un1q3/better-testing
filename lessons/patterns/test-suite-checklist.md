# Better Test Suite Checklist
- [ ] Do the test cases make hand-checks easy?
- [ ] Do test cases check for the wrong kind of data—for example, a negative number of employees in a payroll program?
- [ ] Have all simple boundaries been tested: maximum, minimum, and off-by-one boundaries?
- [ ] Have compound boundaries been tested—that is, combinations of input data that might result in a computed variable that’s too small or too large?
- [ ] Does each requirement that applies to the class or routine have its own test case?
- [ ] Has a list of common errors been used to write test cases to detect errors that have occurred frequently in the past?

Based on my notes from `Martin Fowler - Code Complete`.
